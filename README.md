# First FYP- Research

## Project Name
- Virtual Emotionally Intelligent Therapist 
- Virtual Therapist

## Project Description
- Develop an AI-powered virtual therapist that can engage in conversations with users.
- Listen to their thoughts and concerns, provide emotional support, and offer relevant suggestions for relaxation and mental well-being.

## Key Components
- **Emotion Detection:** Implement a module that can analyze the emotional tone of user input. This could involve sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, or a combination of techniques to understand the user's emotional state.

- **Natural Language Understanding:** Use NLP techniques to understand and parse user input. This could include techniques like named entity recognition, topic modeling, and intent classification to better understand the context of the conversation.

- **Dialogue Management:** Design a dialogue management system that guides the conversation and maintains coherence. Use techniques like rule-based systems or more advanced methods like reinforcement learning for dialogue management.

- **Response Generation:** Develop a mechanism to generate empathetic and relevant responses. This could involve using pre-trained language models (similar to GPT-3) that are fine-tuned for emotional support conversations.

- **Suggestion and Relaxation Techniques:** Incorporate a database of relaxation techniques, meditation exercises, and mental health tips. When appropriate, the system can suggest these techniques to the user to promote relaxation and well-being.

- **User Interaction History:** Keep track of the conversation history to maintain context and provide continuity in the conversation. This can help the system respond more empathetically and coherently.

- **User Experience and Interface:** Create a user-friendly interface, which could be a web application or a mobile app. The interface should allow users to interact with the virtual therapist easily and comfortably.

- **Data Privacy and Ethical Considerations:** Ensure that user data is handled responsibly and with utmost privacy. It's important to address ethical considerations when dealing with mental health conversations.

## Timeline and phases 
- Research and Dataset Collection
- System Architecture Design
- Emotion Recognition and NLP Modules
- Dialogue Management and Response Generation
- User Interface Development
- Testing, Fine-Tuning (of language models)
- Ethical Considerations (Conversations involving mental health require sensitivity and ethical considerations. Make sure the system provides accurate and helpful responses while avoiding harm)
